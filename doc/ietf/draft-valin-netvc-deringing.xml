      <t>This document describes a deringing filter that takes into account the direction of edges and patterns being filtered. The filter works by identifying the direction of each block and then adaptively filtering along the identified direction. In a second pass, the blocks are also filtered in a different direction, with more conservative thresholds to avoid blurring edges. The

      and the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) video codec.</t>

      <t>This document describes a deringing filter that takes into account the direction of edges and patterns being filtered. The filter works by identifying the direction of each block and then adaptively filtering along the identified direction.

    <section title="Direction Search">
      <t>The first step is to divide the image into blocks of fixed or variable size. Variable-size blocks make it possible to use large blocks on long, continuous edges and small blocks where edges intersect or change direction. A fixed block size is easier to implement and does not require signaling the sizes on a block-by-block basis. For this work, we consider a fixed block size of 8x8.</t>

      <t>Once the image is divided into blocks, we determine which direction best matches the pattern in each block. One way to determine the direction is to minimize mean squared difference (MSD) between the input block and a perfectly directional block. A perfectly directional block is a block for which each line along a certain direction has a constant value. For each direction, we assign a line number to each pixel, as shown below.

    <t>For each direction d, we compute the value s_d, which is equal to a direction-independent offset minus the MSD (see <xref target="Deringing-Note"/> for detauls) as:

where x_p is the value of pixel p, P_(d,k) is the set of pixels in like k along direction d, and N_(d,k) is the cardinality of P_(d,k). From there, the direction is computed as the value of d that maximizes s_d.

    <section title="Second Stage Filter">
      <t>The 7-tap directional filter is sometimes not enough to eliminate all ringing, so we use an additional filtering step that operates across the direction lines used in the first filter. Considering that the input of the second filter has considerably less ringing than the input of the second filter, and the fact that the second filter risks blurring edges, the position-dependent threshold T_2(i,j) for the second filter is set lower than that of the first filter T. The filter structure is the same as the one used for the directional filter. The direction parameters for the second stage filter are shown in the table below and the filter weights are w=[1 1] with W=16/3.</t>

    <section title="Setting Thresholds">
      <t>The thresholds T and T_2 must be set high enough to smooth out ringing artefacts, but low enough to avoid blurring important details in the image. Although the ringing is roughly proportional to the quantization step size Q, as the quantizer increases the error grows slightly less than linearly because the unquantized coefficients become very small compared to Q. As a starting point for determining the thresholds, Daala uses a power model of the form T_0=level*alpha_1*Q^beta, with beta=0.842, and where alpha_1 depends on the input scaling. The level is a threshold adjustment coded for each superblock (64x64). In the AOM codec, a global threshold is selected by the
      encoder instead of using a function of the quantizer, so T_0=level*global_level.
      </t>

      <t>Another factor that affects the optimal filtering threshold is the presence of strong directional edges/patterns. These can be estimated from the s_d parameters computed in the direction search as delta=s_(d_opt)-s_(d_ortho), where d_ortho=d_opt+4 (mod 8). We compute the direction filtering threshold for each block as 
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
           /  1      /                   1/6  \ \

           \  2      \                        / /
]]></artwork>
</figure>

  where alpha_2 also depends on the input scaling. For the second filter, we use a more conservative threshold that depends on the amount of change caused by the directional filter.
  
<figure align="center">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
              /     T                    \

</t>

      <t>As a special case, when the pixels corresponding to the 8x8 block being filtered are all skipped, then T=T_2=0, so no deringing is performed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Superblock Filtering">

      <t>The filtering is applied one superblock at a time, in a way that depends
        on the level. In Daala, the level can take one of 6 values: 0, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0,
        1.4, 2.0, where a level of zero disables the deringing filter for the current
        superblock. The level is the only information coded in the bitstream by the
        deringing filter. On keyframes, it is entropy-coded based on the neighbor
        values. On inter-predicted frames, the level is only coded for superblocks that
        are not skipped and is entropy-coded based on a single adapted probability
        distribution (no context from the neighbors). Superblocks where no level is
        coded have deringing disabled. Similarly, any skipped block within a superblock
        has deringing disabled, even if it is signaled enabled for the superblock.</t>
      <t>The
        level of the deringing filter in AOM is handled similarly, except that only
        four levels are currently available and there is no entropy coding yet. 
      </t>

      <t>The deringing process sometimes reads pixels that lie outside of the superblock being processed. When these pixels belong to another superblock, the filtering always uses the unfiltered pixel values -- even for the second stage filter -- so that no dependency is added between the superblocks. This makes it possible -- in theory -- to filter all superblocks in parallel. When the pixels used for a filter lie outside of the viewable image, we set f(d,T)=0.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Results">
      <t>The deringing filter described here has been implemented for the Daala <xref target="Daala-website"/> codec. It is available from the Daala Git repository <xref target="Daala-Git"/>. We tested the deringing filter on the Are We Compressed Yet <xref target="AWCY"/> ntt-short1 set over the 0.025 bit/pixel to 0.1 bit/pixel range, corresponding to a 1080p30 bitrate of 1.5 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s. The Bjontegaard-delta <xref target="I-D.daede-netvc-testing"/> rate reduction over that range was 6.5% for PSNR, 4.7% for PSNR-HVS, 5.6% for SSIM and -6.0% (regression) for FAST-SSIM. Visual inspection confirmed that the quality is indeed improved, despite the regression in the FAST-SSIM result.
      </t>

      <t>In AOM for the ntt-short1 set, the medium bitrate (0.02 to 0.06 bit/pixel) 
        Bjontegaard-delta improvement is 2.5% for PSNR, 1.5% for PSNR-HVS, 1.5% for
        SSIM, and -3.8% (regression) on FAST-SSIM. The high bitrate (0.06 to
        0.2 bit/pixel) Bjontegaard-delta improvement is 2.0% for PSNR, 0.8% for
        PSNR-HVS, 1.3% for SSIM, and -3.1% (regression) on FAST-SSIM.</t>

      <t>The smaller
        improvement for AOM compared to Daala may be due to the newly integrated
        code not being mature, but also to the fact that some features in Daala
        tend to cause more ringing. These features include lapped transforms,        quantization matrices, perceptual vector quantization, overlapped
        block motion compensation (OBMC), and activity masking.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusion">
      <t>We have demonstrated an effective algorithm to remove ringing artefacts from coded images and videos. The proposed filter takes into account the directionality of the patterns it is filtering to reduce the risk of blurring.</t>
